I used mholmes' version of ACC Mysticism, made a few adjustments like changing the reagents back so they didn't use ACC's regs. I adjusted the Rising Colossus and the Animated Weapon spells to make them a bit tougher. Also any Mysticism spell based on Imbuing has been changed to Focus. I looked all over the forums to make sure it wasn't present. I apologize if someone else already uploaded it.

 Thanks to:
 A_Li_N for the CCC and CSS systems, along with the Central Memory
 mholmes for his ACC Mysticism

 Required:
 A_Li_N Completely Custom Core

 Installation instructions:
 Extract archive into a folder.
 Copy the Mysticism folders into the ACC Spell Systems folder (ACC\Complete Spell System\-=+ 03 Systems).
 Copy the school.cs file into the Changing folder (ACC\Complete Spell System\-=+ 02 Changing) and overwrite the one that's there.

 EDIT: (1-10-2012) Bushido and Ninjitsu have been removed from this system. With the exception of 1 or 2 things in either school that are actual spells, the rest are moves, and there is no way to register moves with ACC.
