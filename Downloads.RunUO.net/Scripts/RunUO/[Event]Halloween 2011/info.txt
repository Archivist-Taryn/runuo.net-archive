Here is Gift Giving for Halloween. The trick or treat basket for some reason says you need a goodie bag to trick or treat when you get the treats(dont have time to get that removed, you can figure it out)Just say "trick or treat" to vendors with the basket in your backpack. You have 31 uses on the trick or treat bag.
Gift Giving starts 10-29-11 and ends on 11-4-11. Change the dates to whatever you would like. Also change the Gift Giving message to have your server name, not Shazzy's Shard.

Items include:
Lollipops, jelly beans, taffy and wrapped candy, all give toothaches.
Black cat statuette.
Skulls on pike.
Grim Warning.
Ruined Tapestry.
Pumpkin scarecrow.
Flippable 4 way halloween web in orange, black or white.

2 dying house plants on Gift Giving that say "A house plant killed by.." and the mobs name.
2 Spookie carved pumpkins on Gift Giving also have the "A spookie pumpkin carved by..."and the mobs name.
Added a ShadowToken to the Halloween Gift Box you get along with the above items.(If you dont have the ShadowToken deeds already on your server you will need those)

Holler if you have questions.

Enjoy,

Koluch
