I bring you 72 (yes, that's seventy-two) custom-made artifacts. I wrote these forever ago when I was staffing on a server called Eclipse - which has since shut down. I've seen some of these on a couple other servers here and there, so I figured I'd just release it for everyone to use 

Inside, you will find a huge list of artifacts, and a few folders. The first folder being "Deeds" which includes some bonus items, such as A Bow Balancing Deed, A Bow Velocity Deed, and a Weapon Renaming Tool. (please note, the renaming tool does not override the resource type, so if you renamed a valorite katana to "pwner", it would said "Valorite Pwner")

Secondly, there is a folder called LanternCollection. When I staffed on Eclipse, everyone wanted a lantern that could be spellchanneling so you could use it while casting - of course, regular lanterns can't have spellchanneling on them, so I wrote these as a little bonus. I'm sure some of you will appreciate it. (And yes, these lanterns are lightable!)

Lastly, there is a folder called OPArties - these are of course, the artifacts that were a little too overpowered even for my taste. I would recommend going through every artifact in the list to make sure it's balanced enough for you, but they shouldn't be too bad.

Just throw these somewhere in your scripts folder, and compile!

Enjoy!
