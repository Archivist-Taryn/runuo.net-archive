Boots of Swiftness
 Boots that give a speed boost to players for a certain amount of time!

 By default it can be activated only once a day, and will last for 1 minute. However, you can change these settings in the script by editing the configuration region:



Code (text):


         #region Configuration
  
         // Players can use it only once a day by default
         // Be sure to edit warning message: "You need to wait for a day until the magic recharges."
         private static readonly TimeSpan UsageInterval = new TimeSpan(1, 0, 0, 0);
         // Effect lasts for 1 minute by default
         private static readonly TimeSpan EffectDuration = new TimeSpan(0, 0, 1, 0);
         // Hue of the boots
         private const int BootsHue = 2763;
  
         #endregion
 Change the TimeSpan arguments to the desired time interval. The arguments are as follows:



Code (text):

TimeSpan(days, hours, minutes, seconds)
 If you want it to be used again in 2 hours, 29 minutes and 59 seconds then set it to:



Code (text):

TimeSpan(0, 2, 29, 59)
 Some insight:
 •The item is not usable when the person is polymorphed.
 •It also loses its effect when the person polymorphes.
 •If the person takes the boots off, the effects are gone.
 I have written this script for Oblivion Shard@RunUO v2.1 and had to generalize it a bit for publishing purposes, so you might encounter some errors due to that. But if you need any help please ask and I will answer your questions, or patch the script if needed.

 You will need to change the hue value in the configuration as Oblivion Shard uses a different hues.mul.



 Ideas for improvements are welcome, and bug reports are encouraged!
