What They Do

These containers can be marked like a recall rune. When a rune is dropped into the container, it marks it automatically for the location the container was marked. It also automatically sets the runes description the same as the container's description.

This makes a great house addon so guildies can mark runes all at once with ease. You can make multiples on the fly in your own home!

Features

- Does all of the same checks as a recall rune when marked.
- Can be marked inside a home, just like a recall rune as well. It will set the location the same as a house rune.
- Changes color based on the map the rune was marked, just like a recall rune.
- Single click the container and click rename to change it's description. This is what runes will be named when dropped in.

Installation

1. Drop the included Mark.cs and overwrite your old one.
2. Drop MarkableContainer.cs in your customs folder (or anywhere else in the scripts folder you choose).
3. Restart and enjoy.

To Make Them Craftable (Optional)

Add this to your DefCarpentry:


Code:

index = AddCraft( typeof( MarkableContainer ), 1044294, "markable container", 95.0, 100.0, typeof( Log ), 1044041, 250, 1044351 );
AddRes( index, typeof( MarkScroll ), "Mark Scroll", 20, 1044253 );
ForceNonExceptional( index );

*I put them after the engravers on our project.
