Hiya, very simple mod here I think makes human npc's a little more fitting with the uo feel. Simply lets npc's with a human body able to use the mantra's as players do. In Spell.cs in the SayMantra Method replace this code:


Code:
			if ( m_Info.Mantra != null && m_Info.Mantra.Length > 0 && (m_Caster.Player ) )With this:


Code:
			if ( m_Info.Mantra != null && m_Info.Mantra.Length > 0 && (m_Caster.Player || m_Caster.Body.IsHuman) )Show Your Support
