The first, and only, real custom expansion to RunUO, Blue Magic.

This system primarily focuses on the Final Fantasy's Blue Magic concept but it's not all about the mages so to speak. The system is almost totally drag and drop and only requires about four lines of code edits to a single file. Overall, about two dozen quests will be added, dozens of custom craftable/upgradable items, over 30 new spells, 40+ new special attacks, a new town and meeting area, new dungeons, new pets, you name it. And best of all, this system is both currently expanding and well supported by it's author. All you have to do is submit your bugs here and I'll fix them for you.

A little warning though, this isn't a cake walk system designed to be handed in it's entirely to a new player. This is an advanced expansion. It requires work and effort on your players part. On my primary testing site (CoV) the players there love it but required some hand holding to know what they were doing. Things reached a point there will the Pokemon Trainer and Blue Mage run tandem on quests which is exactly what I wanted. Anyway, on to details!

Setting Up
Download the attached rar, if you' using the Orb SVN just unzip it unto your customs folder and you're done. If you using default RunUO you'll have to go into the BME files and unzip the Mobile Abilities files and make the edits to Scripts\Misc\AOS. Don't worry, it's really simple. Load the world and run the [bluespawn command.

Note on "Near Class" System
Blue Mages cannot have more than 50.0 for their base skill in Magery, Necromancy, Chivalry, Spellweaving, or Mysticism. You are allowed you use items to increase your skill value up to your cap as normal. Additionally, the author (me) has a zero tolerance for Blue Mage Tamers and you cannot have more than 0.0 in Animal Taming.

Should your skill be higher than the allowed value your skills will be lower on joining and each and every single time you cast a Blue Spell. Pokemon style shards have literally taken over freeshards and thanks to Druidic Spells offering such things as infinite mana and four times better healing rate as a mass spells being offered in FSATS there is no reason to train any skill other than Animal Taming and Magery (for 2 of its 64 spells, mark & gate). This is me breaking you of that standard, and don't worry too much, since Bushido is allowed you can train and breed a Lesser Hiyru, you'll have to heal it like you should (veterinary).

Additionally the secondary systems make use of the NPC Guild System. OSI/EA never expanded on them outside of the Thieves Guild is able to use Disguise Kits and steal from players. This means you can only get one "shiny new thing" per character. Since Blue Mages are not tied to the NPc guilds this doesn't mean you can't make a Blue Mage Artificer so go ahead and try it, but I did prevent the craftable Golems from bonding to Blue Mages 

Becoming a Blue Mage
*Currently BlueBen isn't spawned into the world via the generator command, this means you'll have to add him your self (where ever you wish) just be sure he is created off a spawner. Removal of him, like ANY MondainQuester will crash your saves.*

Run up and talk to Ben. If your Forensics skill is below 51 you're offered a New Haven style skill training quest. The 51 threshold rather than 50 means you can start with the maximum amount of skill and still reap the rewards. Once you have over 51 in Forensics you'll be asked a series of questions and then sent on a go fetch quest based on your answers. It's ML style so you'll have to mark the item as a "Quest Item", then turn it in. You'll be given one last confirmation menu and then you're in.

Learning and Using Spells
80% of the spells are learned by getting hit by them and nearly every monster spawns in Ilshenar. Beneficial spells can only be learned by studying the corpse of the monster whom teaches it (by using [bm study). A couple of spells are learned by other various means, for instance Auto Life is learned as a quest reward and Angel's Snack is a lootable item.

To cast a spell it's as simple as typing in [bm, you'll be given a menu showing a list of spells know along with buttons to cast or to inquire further information on them. The command supports a wide range of arguments meant for macroing too. By adding the name of a spell (no spaces) you can cast the desired spell without having to open or click on the menu. For example open your client options, add a new say type macro, bind to which ever key, and for the text box type in [bm whitewind. Now you have a key binding for casting your healing spell (assuming you know it). you can use [bm help at any time in game for a summery of what it can do for you too.

Questing - Blue Touched
A special type of clothing was designed for Blue Mages called Blue Touched, the concept is based off Dungeon & Dragons:Online's Dragon touched garments. The clothing can only be worn by Blue Mages though. By signing up for the Tier 1 slayer you'll get a random article of blessed clothing with 5% resists. The Tier 2 gives an enhancement scroll and the Tier 3 gives a second scroll that stacks with the Tier 2 scroll. There are 9 different enhancements, or 81 possible combinations, for 9 different layers of clothing. And of course a 10th enhancement for the 10th item.

1.13 Update (more beta crap by Peo!)

•Folders reordered, you'll have to do a full removal of the old folder and drop the new on in to update.
•New Monk quests, a quest for the gloves, 0 to 1, 1 to 2, and 2 to 3 upgrades are in as beta tests.
•New Objective for the MLQuest system called Study. Like the Solen quest you just walk over to an area and wait.
•Seems like it works though the quests are only coded as far as flavor with some study objectives to test handling.
•Do not use these quests on you're live shard until further testing, which you may participate in if you desire.
•New Other folder which will be used to hold misc things not tied to Guilds or Blue Mage
•BankStorageDeed (the one I posted on RunUO), used it to increase your maximum bank storage count.
•HealByEatting, if you have TasteID you can heal HP by eating food. Awesome!

As noted, there is more than just Blue Magic in this expansion.

Monk
* Currently they are not offered in game and must be added or leveled by staff *
Also stolen form DDO, the MonkFists can be worn, taking up both the Gloves & Two Handed Weapon slot, and are an entire system into them selves.

Level able
The gloves start out at level 1 and scale up to level 5. Each level increases the base damage, property scaling of your stance, strike/finisher damage, and at level 3 you can use the Balance of Light and Darkness (see below). Also when they hit level five they visually change into the Dragon Gloves.

Stance
By clicking on the gloves once you can change your stance, gaining one of four property sets.

Strike
By double clicking on them you'll open the main menu for them. you can select one of six different elemental strikes. Air (energy), Earth (physical), Fire, Water (cold), Dark (chaos), or Light (direct, but deals less). the menu highlights the maneuver selected in red exactly like a normal special move too. An additional planned expansion of a 7th element (void) can be seen in the code but is currently unused or finished.

Finisher
Depending on the last three strikes you used you could be given a new maneuver. There are currently 14 possible finishers, 1/3 of them center around party buffs which instantly bestow some sort of bonus to everyone in your party. 

Wholeness of Body
In the upper right of the menu is a small clickable icon. Using this will dump your mana and you'll enter a mediative state. While in this state you'll rapidly regenerate Hit Points and upon exiting you'll regain (most or more) of your mana back.

Balance of Light and Dark (unfinished)
Only available if your gloves are level 3 or above. By using Light or Dark moves you'll see two bars slowly filling up. Upon one of them being filled you'll get to use one of two effects. They are more spell like then an attacking maneuver but their effects can be pretty impressive.

Other Items
Jidz Tetka (bracers) & Monks Belt interact with the fists for additional bonuses. Additionally the Dragonsale Chest sports some high resistances and is meant to be used by anyone, not just monks, provided they are a 3rd level veteran. These will rare drops from bosses or quest rewards (like leveling) later on.

Assassin
* Unfinished, need to make the quests and generator command really *
Bonus bonuses for the Thieves Guild. Designed around simple espionage type quests that make use of the Lockpicking, Snooping, Stealth, & Stealing skills. Also assassination combat.

Quest completion will yield special token type items which can buy your assassin gear. The gear it's self can be upgraded in the form of gaining an extra property (level 2) and Blessed (level 3). The 12 item set of gear pretty much maxes out your none-spellcasting properties outside of Damage Increase (it only hits +75%) and greatly increases your maximum HP. Some of the gear have special traits, such as the Vest can hold poisoned daggers much like a Ninja Belt and the Belt can stock Healing Potions (which heal a decent amount). The sword even gets a bonus to damage if you hit the backside of a creature.

The system also include a command that allows you to use Armor Ignore, Bleed Attack, Mortal Blow, Shadow Strike, and a new move called Assassinate no matter which weapon you are using. Assassin works just like Bushido's Lightning Strike, expect if your target is at full life you get a very special four times modifier to base damage.

And finally, a special loot map item was made for the various towns. They show the location of a container you can steal out of, though default RunUO hardly even uses them. You can expect later updates to change dozens of the empty containers to spawn loot like they should.

Artificer
* Works for the most part, working on balance and so it's staff only. *
Trying to make the ItemID skill useful now, so behold the Artificer crafting stuff. The NPC Guild required for Access is the Tinker's Guild.

Rune Bow
Guess what else I stole from DDO? Artificer Rune Arms ^_^
During the crafting process you'll choose your shot type, build type (pretty much is it a repeater or heavy?), and special slayer. Crafting the bow also consumes 25 points of ItemID and can only be used by Artificers (though not necessarily it's crafter). Once donned, double clicking it will open a menu with a bar that fills up over time. Clicking the button fires the special shot type and you may fire a charge early, it just deals less damage. Other than that, the bows use ItemID instead of Archery.

Spell Binding
You can craft Spell Trigger items and Golems using this menu. This is not the same craft menu you are used to, instead it's a nice little scroll with some fancy buttons. As long as you have the minimum skill you always succeed too.

Spell Binding - Magery (unfinished)
Craft the Magery wands, Arcane Gems, or special self marking Recall Runes from here.

Spell Binding - Necromancy
Five of the Necromancer spells can be crafted, Animate Dead, Blood Oath, Corpse Skin, Evil Omen, and Pain Spike. The staves, like Chiv maces, gain addition properties if welding by someone with skill points in Neco. Unlike Magery, Necromancery is somewhat a combat based spellcasting skill. So I couldn't just give you a want that was utterly useless in combat.

Spell Binding - Chivalry
Cleanse By Fire, Close Wounds, Consecrate Weapon, Divine Fury, and Remove Curse can be crafted in the forms of various maces or hammers. They gain various properties when held by someone with Chivalry skill.

Spell Binding - Golem
Four custom golems can be crafted, they appear as a unique item and double clicking the item will summon the golem. You can only have one of them in your backpack so to "stock pile" these you'll have to drop them to the world or trade them to other players. the golems them selves have a healing penalty and only heal 1/2 of the amount issued to them. You may double click on the golem, entering an mediative state, to provide an additional unpenalized source of healing. Lastly, commanding and bonding the golems is based on ItemID though Blue Mages can never bond a golem.

The four golems are Diablo II style and here they are.
Clay: Hits for Mortal Blow.
Blood: Leech Life (heals him and his master).
Fire: I herd u leik fire so this golem has Hit Fireball, Hit fire Attack, a Fire Aura, and even deals fire damage when hit.
Iron: Part of the summoning process requires you to sacrifice an item, the golem comes into play wearing the item allowing you to craft a golem with high properties or such.

Other Items
Really only three artifacts were made, two of them are jewelry. They have no other properties other than Spell Damage +25%, which still is extremely powerful. Dunno how they will be offered in game yet, thinking of an assembly type set up.

A more detailed read me is contained in the system, though it is of the lowest priority to keep updated.

Ilshenar Map

Legend
Monster with a spell in the over world.
Monster with a spell is in a cave or dungeon and this is the entrance.
One of the Marks for Blue Mage entry can be found in here.
This is the location of the Custom Cave Dungeon, a bunch of spells can be learned here.

Expect to see in future updates

•Another custom dungeon currently dubbed the "Hole", and it's not cave themed.
•The "Hole" will contain another slew of new monsters to teach you most of the remaining unlearnable spells.
•New town, central hub for Blue Magic. As you can see from the scripts I have started integrating it in.
•Ranger Addition; I may hate pets, but expect to see Camping interact with monsters in a certain way.
•"U", that huge dungeon I brag about, at 17,000 items & 400x400 for the main area now.
•And lastly, Eldritch Infusions. The final thing for Artificers.

FAQ

Q: I already did the Tier 1 Slayer, how come it won't offer a T2?
A: The slayer quests are randomized, since the deeds are random you and rerun any level again if you hate the deed. Just keep retrying.

Q: Hey, I kept looking under the reward for a T1 and canceling out until it (finally) said it was going to give me a Cloak, I really need that one to complete my collection, but on completion it gave me another pair of Gloves.
A: It's true you can keep reasking for the quest and checking the reward, but a new World Load (restart) rerandomizes it, just try to complete the T1 in as little time as you can. some shard go down nightly for updates, repairs, or even maintenance.

Q: So if I delete BlueBen my saves will crash?
A: Yes, an unfortunate side effect of the MondainQuester. Once you complete a quest, the mobile whom offered it is saved, if the mobile isn't in the world, blam crash. If the mobile no longer offers the quest, blam crash. This isn't exclusive to BlueBen and any ML quest, custom or official, has this problem. The Orb SVN will have a fix to prevent this problem later on.

Q: If some of this stuff is unfinished, why did you give it to me?
A: What did you say guinea pig?

Q: Hey, what is this Battle Quest stuff?
A: Plan to have 5 super bosses, sign up for the quest, the party is ported in, you die. Fun times. (psst, Markov may say something about the OmniAI, just comment that part out ok).

Q: Why are you doing this? I want my SA.
A: Why dedicate so much time to coding someone else's creation (ea) when I can code my own expansion?

Q: I got a damage error on the MonkFists.
A: RunUO added a boolean to the AOS.Damage a dozen releases ago but didn't add an overrider to support the last method, just edit as needed.

Q: StringBuilder.Clear error?
A: .NET 4.0 only method, if you're using RunUO you're still using 2.2. It doesn't dispose like I thought it did and using ((object)sb).Dispose(); is worse than ignoring it. The line will simply be removed next update.
