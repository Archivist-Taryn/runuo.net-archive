Based off of the original Ultima series virtue questions.
 I have updated the script to operate closer to the way the original Ultima virtue
 questions worked. The first four questions are a random mix of the 8 virtues,
 compared two at a time. Question five compares the player's choices from
 questions one and two, question six compares the player's choices from questions
 three and four, and the last question compares the player's choices from
 questions five and six.

 Since I was using these scripts to set the player's initial statistics, this
 method works better for me. :> And keeps the stats from being too lopsided.

 One of the drawbacks to this system is that the original 8 virtues have no place
 for neromancers, true rogues (rather than bards), or any of the professions that
 have arisen from Ultima Online's skills like treasure hunter, or the upcoming
 Ninja and Samurai (bet that's gonna date this document. ;> =) So I've designed
 this script to give a "recommended" profession and let the character go on their
 way. The intent is for the player starting area to have a gypsy and a selection
 of character gates that the player can choose a class fromThings you should know:

 The scripts also resets all the character's statistics at the beginning if the
 player accepts the telling. These changes can be easily commented out, and start
 at line 108 in VirtueTellerMainGump.cs

 Each question answered will give the character a small stat bonus, 6 points spread
 across one or more statistics. This method is easy to change, and can be totally
 disabled by uncommenting one line (a "return" before any stat changes take place)
 or the values can be adjusted. The method begins at line 437 in VirtueQuestionGump.cs

 Usage:

 You can use the "VirtueFortuneTeller" or the "VirtueTarot" cards, or a combination
 of both along with appropriate decorations. The initial gump is called when either
 the cards or the fortune teller are double-clicked on.

 The fortune teller may be spawned or simply placed, she's blessed by default and
 will not move from where she's created.
