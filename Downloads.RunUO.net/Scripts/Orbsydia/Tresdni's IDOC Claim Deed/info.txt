This deed makes for a great donation gift or other nice shop item. It requires one small core mod.

What It Does

The player double clicks the deed and targets the house sign of a house that is in danger of collapsing (IDOC). It automatically transfers full ownership of the home and it's contents to the player.

Features

- Only works if the home is IDOC.
- Only works from the players pack.
- Checks if the player can own another home. This also supports the multiple houses per account mod, because it uses the method HasAccountHouse from BaseHouse.cs.
- Clears the friends, bans, and co-owners.
- Changes the locks if pre-aos, and gives the player new keys.
- Instantly refreshes the home. 

Simple Core Mod

In Scripts/Multis/HouseSign.cs around line 13:

Change


Code:
private BaseHouse m_Owner;

to

Code:
public BaseHouse m_Owner;
