Hey All,


I after promising people a new alignment system, here it is!


I've made it fully stand-alone from my Race System so it can be used without it.


This includes the alignments from DnD:




•Lawful Good
•Neutral Good
•Chaotic Good
•Lawful Neutral
•True Neutral
•Chaotic Neutral
•Lawful Evil
•Neutral Evil
•Chaotic Evil

This system only adds the properties, what you do with it or how you set them is entirely upto you.


This does require edits to Playermobile and Notoriety. 


All edits can be found in the Installation Text.


This system also allows Good and Evil to be at war, to show alignment titles or even deactivate certain alignments.


Simple look in AlignmentSystem.cs for the setup to your needs.


Note: At War and Titles are defaulted to false.
