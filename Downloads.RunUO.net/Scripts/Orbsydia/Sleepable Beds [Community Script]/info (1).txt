Just a little fix on a nice system that someone wrote years ago and posted to the forum. I'm not sure how popular this was/is, but I've enjoyed this script a lot. This package is completely plug and play.. All I did was restructure 3 files into a base script and renamed some of the methods to make a little better sense. I also regioned the scripts out so that everyone can make new beds easily. None of the work in this package is my work or idea - I just restructured it and fixed some of the body positions; the body on the large bed now positions correctly!... Finally I also added public beds for those that didn't have them before. What this does is allows you to add them to inns so people can use the bed to go afk or (if you tweak the way RunUO allows players to securely login and log out) you can possibly make the public beds effectively act like a bedroll thus allowing players to secure logout on sleep.
