Hi guys i have fixed "Palace of Paroxysmus" same as i found on "UoGuide" Site :

- After collecting 4 reagent (Skull Legs Torso and Spleen), player throw it on Parox Cauldron and recive 3 "Slimy Ointment".

- DoubleClicking 1 of 3 "Slimy Ointment" player became immune to "Acid River Poison", and can pass through it for clicking the "Iron Gate" for enter on Parox Dungeon and Kill Chief Paroximus.

- After Killing Boss the 3 Key desappears.


Without this modification player recive 3 "Slimy Ointment", and doubleclicking it gain the access for Kill Paroximus Boss


For implement this new Engines i modified some file :

- "Palace of Paroxysmus" folder, must move in "RunUO\Scripts\Expansions\Mondain's Legacy\Engines\Peerless System" folder overwritting existing file

- "PeerlessAltar.cs" , must move in "RunUO\Scripts\Expansions\Mondain's Legacy\Engines\Peerless System" folder overwritting existing file

- "Regions" folder, must move in "RunUO\Scripts\Expansions\Mondain's Legacy" folder overwritting existing file

- "PlayerMobile.cs", must move in "RunUO\Scripts\Mobiles" folder overwritting existing file
