Hey All,

Here's an idea I had to implement `Feats` into UO.

This system is Incomplete, I will be working on it, however I thought I would release it as it is, so you guys can work with it aswell.
Unless you have an Orc Race - All references to orc, will need to be commented out.

In this system I have managed to write:



•BaseFeat - All Feats are derived from this class.
•RegenHits Feat - Untested! This is meant to work by allowing quicker health regeneration during combat.
•Resistance Feat - Untested! This is meant to add resistances to the carrier. 


All feats are weightless and invisible.

I have written the command - [feats to open up the feats gump.

I have only written the Human Gump for now, and the Passive Feats.

1 Example Active Feat Uploaded.

Passive Feats Include:



•Advanced Healing - Regen Hits (Explained Above)
•Healers Oath - Increases Healing cap to 120, Anatomy Cap to 120 but reduces Macing Base and Cap to 0.
•Inscription - Increases Inscription Cap to 120.
•Chemical Science - Add 30 to Alchemy and add Mortal and Pestle to Backpack.
•Elemental Resistance - Resistance (Explained Above)
•Furniture Staining - Adds Furniture Dye Tub to Backpack.
•Leather Dying - Adds Leather Dye Tub to Backpack
•Enameling - Add Armor Dye Tub 


All Dye Tubs have been Included which is required for this release.

I will be working on it when I can.

Limited Support will be available.

To show what power this system can provide, here is an example of what I call an `Active` Feat as it requires player interaction to use.
