Another script i found and edited to get working with ForkUo.

 A magical key that unlocks and untraps chests.
 This has been tested, to the BEST of my and others'
 abilities, with player houses and secure chests.
 While I cannot guarantee 100% safety, I can say that
 in the time that I have had this script available
 to the RunUO community, there have not been any
 reports whatsoever of problems with housing or
 secure chests.


 This will, however, quite handily unlock and untrap
 chests in dungeons, player-crafted locked and trapped
 containers that are stolen or looted, etc.


 The keys are single-use, and will disappear after
 being used once.


 MODIFY - Scripts\Items\Misc\Keys.Cs to the following:

 public enum KeyType
 {
 Copper = 0x100E,
 Gold = 0x100F,
 Iron = 0x1010,
 Rusty = 0x1013, // remember comma
 Magic = 0x1012 // add this
 }


 And a friendly reminder: If you sell it in stores,
 remember to take into account the gold gained from locked and
 trapped treasure chests on your shard.
