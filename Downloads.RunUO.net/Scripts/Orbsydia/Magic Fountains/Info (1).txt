A fun script for players to sink there money into script provided by Alari 


MagicFountain - A "magic" fountain, though it will
 be non-magical when first placed, must be set
 magic = true by a Game Master or better. Once "magic",
 you can toss coins into it and get valuable
 prizes. (these vary depending on the type of
 fountain.) All MagicFountains, whether the magical
 bit is set or not, give special messages when drunk
 from, and have a very slight chance of refilling a
 character's health, mana, or stamina (the player will
 see a longer 'fill' message when this happens)

 FountainMessage.Cool: Gives gold (two tries)
 FountainMessage.Warm: Gives a random item, or gold.
 FountainMessage.Clean: Gives a random food, or gold.
 FountainMessage.Calm: Gives a pet horse, or gold.
 FountainMessage.Fruit: Gives a random fruit, or gold.
