This distro modification was created as a way to control who buys from what npc vendor based on player accesslevel. There are 4 edits in the BaseVendor script. This can be implemented on all versions of the core/distro scripts. 

I included a freshly edited distro copy of the BaseVendor.cs... the edits are easy to find:
