Hi guys i have updated Orb Nerun Distro with adding of TerMur Spawn, more user of Orb need this file and i have share with all community my modification of this utility

I have activated TerMur in Nerun Distro and i have created spawn of all Region searching in UOStratic wich monster spawning in each location

The archive contain "Nerun Distro" folder and "Data" folder with all moddification

- Nerun Distro Folder must be move in Custom folder overwritting the existing Folder (DONT DELETE OLD FILE ! only overwrite this)

- Data Folder must be place in Runuo Folder overwritting the old file with this new version (DONT DELETE OLD FILE ! only overwrite this)


Active Runuo and spawn all location of TerMur and re-create all World, save and restart
